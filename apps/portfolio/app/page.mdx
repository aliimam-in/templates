Hello, World! I am [Ali Imam](https://aliimam.in/) - a Design Engineer driven by a passion for crafting high-performance, user-focused software solutions with intuitive and captivating designs. With over 10 years of experience, I specialize in developing top-tier web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and cutting-edge front-end technologies. Outside of work, I’m an avid explorer of new tech and love bringing creative ideas to life through personal projects.

I’m currently building a free, open-source [Design](https://aliimam.in/) Library to empower developers and designers with accessible, high-quality designs. My goal is to create resources that inspire and simplify the process of building beautiful, functional applications.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
