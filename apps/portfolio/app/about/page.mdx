## Jane Doe

<Small>Product Designer & Developer</Small>

As a product designer and developer, I bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality. At my current role with Horizon Labs, I design user-centric interfaces and code scalable front-end solutions. My focus is on creating seamless digital experiences that are both visually appealing and technically robust.

I specialize in React, TypeScript, and UI/UX design, while also exploring 3D visualization and animation to bring interfaces to life. I’m a lifelong learner, constantly experimenting with new tools and sharing insights through blog posts and community talks.

## Freelance Projects

- Web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- User-centered design principles
- Agile workflows and collaboration
- Prototyping and iterative design

These early experiences shaped my approach to creating thoughtful, user-focused solutions and fueled my passion for blending creativity with technology.
